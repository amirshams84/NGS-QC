    "#### Concept and method of implementation\n",
    "##### I used SWARM system to run several QC metrics, such as fastQC and Kraken based on Eric QC recipe, over each fastq file within a single directory in parallel mode. Python script will parse the input directory and create a hash table based on the metadata CSV file's parameters; Then it will generate a swarm file based on that. This python script will also create a shell script separately for the multiQC step. Since multiQC should execute at the last step, the shell script used --dependency method in SBATCH system- binds the execution of multiQC script to the swarm script completion. All these functions are managed by a general bash script, which will control this structure. This bash script will be the third output of the python script.\n",

    "1. QC swarm file\n",
    "2. multiQC script\n",
